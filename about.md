My name is Lense Swaenen. I'm a Belgian mathematical engineer. Since 2012 I have been employed at [Sioux Technologies](https://www.sioux.eu) in Eindhoven (in the Netherlands), currently in the role of Mathware Architect and Technology Manager on Optimization in the [Mathware department](https://www.sioux.eu/competences/mathware/). In 2012 I finished my university studies at the KULeuven. There, I obtained a Masters degree in Mathematical Engineering as well as a Masters degree in Physics (theoretical physics).

This blog is to host some applied mathematical output of mine. Some work related, but mostly not. A secondary overview of some mathematical output would be my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_eXrzywAAAAJ&hl=nl)

### More about work
Sioux is a 'technology partner', which basically means we do projects for other companies. Eindhoven has a lot of high tech industry, so we get to do a lot of fun stuff. I'm mainly involved in project that have a mathematical optimization component. That subdomain also has a Sioux [landing page](https://www.sioux.eu/competences/mathware/optimization/)

Until 2020, the Mathware department of Sioux was known as LIME. LIME's branding included a mascot, 'het slimoentje'. My current header image is [The March of Progress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_of_Progress) reinterpreted with 'slimoentje' and the history of mathematics. This artwork was created for the retirement of the former boss of LIME: Professor Bob Mattheij. Other header images have been taken from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/).

### More about myself
I'm 34 years old, I live in Hoogstraten, Belgium with my wife and 2 daughters. I'm a racket sports enthusiast. Table tennis is my main sport: I play competitively and am also the head coach at my local club. Tennis, squash, padel, racketlon and badminton I've all done competetively to some lesser extent and a little less lately with fatherhood and all. Other interest are movies and board games.
