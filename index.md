Welcome! I am Lense, a Belgian mathematical engineer. Since 2012 I have been employed at [Sioux Technologies](https://www.sioux.eu) in Eindhoven (in the Netherlands), currently being the technology manager on optimization in the [Mathware department](https://www.sioux.eu/competences/mathware/). 

This blog is to host some applied mathematical output of mine. Some work related, but mostly not.

Check the [about](about) page for more info on me.
