Welcome! I am Joris and I am interested in research at the intersection of machine learning and language. I have worked on compositionality and interpretability, and recently became more interested in probabilistic models such as VAEs and Bayesian Deep Learning for text. I also like software engineering and hiking. Check the [about](about) page to learn more about what I do and have done.

I occasionally write blogposts. You can find them down below.
